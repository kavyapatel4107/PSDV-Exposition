    "text": "We are a team of three members: Kavya Patel, Krish Patil, and Nachiket Patil. In this article, we will explore the Ipychart library, which is used explicitly for Python in Jupyter Notebook. Ipychart is a Python library that leverages the power of Chart.js to enable the creation of fully interactive, customizable, and modular charts directly within Jupyter Notebooks. It allows seamless chart creation using Python syntax, supports integration with pandas data frames for quick visualization, and offers features like dynamic tooltips, zooming, and predefined color schemes. Particularly useful for data scientists and analysts, Ipychart simplifies data visualization by enabling the creation of visually appealing, interactive charts without leaving the Jupyter Notebook environment, streamlining exploratory data analysis and presentation."

    "text": "\\[Code~Examples\\]\nExample 1\nWe imported Chart from the ipychart library and random to generate random values. A seed was set for consistency, and the data dictionary was created with a dataset labeled “Product Popularity.” Each data point has a random x value, a y value between 1 and 5, and a radius (r) based on another random value. The bubbles are styled with a purple fill and an indigo border. Using the Chart function, we created a bubble chart, with a legend positioned at the top. Finally, display(bubble_chart) renders the chart, visually representing product popularity.\n\nfrom ipychart import Chart\nimport random\n\nrandom.seed(0)\n\ndata = {\n    \"datasets\": [{\n        \"label\": \"Product Popularity\",\n        \"data\": [{\"x\": random.randint(100, 500), \"y\": random.uniform(1, 5), \"r\": random.randint(100, 500) / 20} for _ in range(10)],\n        \"backgroundColor\": \"rgba(128, 0, 128, 0.6)\",\n        \"borderColor\": \"rgba(75, 0, 130, 1)\",\n        \"borderWidth\": 2\n    }]\n}\n\nbubble_chart = Chart(\n    data=data,\n    kind=\"bubble\",\n    options={\n        \"plugins\": {\n            \"legend\": {\"position\": \"top\"}\n        }\n    }\n)\n\ndisplay(bubble_chart)\n\n\n\n\nOutput:\nExample 2\nWe imported Chart from the ipychart library to create an interactive bar chart. The data dictionary defines product labels and sales data for 2024 and 2025, each represented with a unique color. Using the Chart function, we generated a bar graph to compare sales performance across different products. The tooltip plugin allows users to see details when hovering over bars, while the legend at the top helps differentiate the datasets. Finally, display(chart) renders the chart, making it easy to visualize and analyze sales trends.\n\nfrom ipychart import Chart\n\ndata = {\n    \"labels\": [\"Product A\", \"Product B\", \"Product C\", \"Product D\", \"Product E\"],\n    \"datasets\": [\n        {\"label\": \"2024 Sales\", \"data\": [300, 400, 500, 600, 450], \"backgroundColor\": \"#36A2EB\"},\n        {\"label\": \"2025 Sales\", \"data\": [350, 450, 550, 650, 500], \"backgroundColor\": \"#FF6384\"}\n    ]\n}\n\nchart = Chart(\n    data=data,\n    kind=\"bar\",\n    options={\n        \"plugins\": {\n            \"tooltip\": {\"enabled\": True, \"mode\": \"index\"},\n            \"legend\": {\"display\": True, \"position\": \"top\"}\n        },\n        \"scales\": {\n            \"x\": {\"title\": {\"display\": True, \"text\": \"Products\"}},\n            \"y\": {\"title\": {\"display\": True, \"text\": \"Sales Volume\"}}\n        }\n    }\n)\n\ndisplay(chart)\n\n\n\n\nOutput:\nExample 3\nWe imported pandas to manage data and polarplot from ipychart to create a polar chart. A DataFrame was created with categories like Speed, Reliability, Comfort, Safety, and Efficiency, each assigned a numerical value. Using the polarplot function, we mapped categories to the axes and plotted their corresponding values in a circular format. This visualization helps compare different attributes in a structured manner. Finally, display(chart) renders the polar chart, making it easy to analyze category-wise performance.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom ipychart import polarplot\n\ndata = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"Category\": [\"Speed\", \"Reliability\", \"Comfort\", \"Safety\", \"Efficiency\"],\n    \"Values\": [35, 38, 65, 70, 24]\n})\n\nchart = polarplot(\n    data=data,\n    x=\"Category\",\n    y=\"Values\"\n)\n\ndisplay(chart)\n\n\n\n\nOutput:\nExample 4\nWe imported pandas to handle data and Chart from ipychart to create a pie chart. A DataFrame was created with smartphone companies and their respective market shares. The data dictionary extracts company names as labels and their market shares as values, assigning unique colors to each segment. Using the Chart function, we generated a pie chart to visualize market distribution. The tooltip plugin enables hover details, while the legend on the right helps identify each company. Finally, display(pie_chart) renders the chart, providing a clear visual representation of market share distribution.\n\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom ipychart import Chart\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({\n    \"Company\": [\"Apple\", \"Samsung\", \"Huawei\", \"Xiaomi\", \"Oppo\", \"Vivo\"],\n    \"Market_Share\": [30, 25, 15, 12, 10, 8]\n})\n\ndata = {\n    \"labels\": df[\"Company\"].tolist(),\n    \"datasets\": [{\n        \"label\": \"Market Share\",\n        \"data\": df[\"Market_Share\"].tolist(),\n        \"backgroundColor\": [\"#3498db\", \"#e74c3c\", \"#f1c40f\", \"#2ecc71\", \"#9b59b6\", \"#e67e22\"],\n        \"borderColor\": \"#fff\",\n        \"borderWidth\": 2\n    }]\n}\n\npie_chart = Chart(\n    data=data,\n    kind=\"pie\", \n    options={\n        \"plugins\": {\n            \"tooltip\": {\"enabled\": True, \"mode\": \"index\"},\n            \"legend\": {\"display\": True, \"position\": \"right\"}\n        },\n        \"layout\": {\n            \"padding\": 50  \n        }\n    }\n)\n\ndisplay(pie_chart)\n\n\n\n\nOutput:"
